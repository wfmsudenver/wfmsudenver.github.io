    <h4>Sometimes I really want to sigh...</h4>
    <p>After all, sighing brings a lot of oxygen to the brain. Plus, there is just a unique bit of satisfaction to be found in the mix of tiredness and preponderance.</p>
    <h4>Other times, I really like yawning</h4>
    <p>I don't really understand the difference between a yawn and a sigh emotionally. The emotions expressed seem to be the same, but maybe we define concious "yawns" as sighs as a means of pretending we have control over our tiredness.</p>
